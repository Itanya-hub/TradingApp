***The TradingWorldApp: A Console-Based Trading Platform***

Project Overview---

The TradingWorldApp is a basic computer application designed to simulate a platform for trading personal items. It was built to demonstrate how a program can manage user accounts, keep track of various items, and provide secure, individualized access. The main goal is to connect users who wish to trade by securely providing them with each other's contact information (email) so they can finalize the exchange outside of the application.

Key Features and Usage---

Secure Login: Users must enter a valid email and password to log in and start a session.

Viewing Available Items: Once logged in, the user can view a list of all items available for tradeâ€”meaning, items owned by other users on the platform.

Initiating a Trade: The user can select an item they are interested in. The application then securely reveals the item owner's email address, which allows the user to begin trade negotiations.

Session Control: Users have options to end their active session by logging out or to exit the application completely.

Default User Credentials--

For testing purposes, the app is pre-loaded with several users and their items:

Nick (sliverlover@nbi.se) owns Silver rings.

Lucas (goldhunting@nbi.se) owns Gold and Pearl necklaces.

Brandon (finna@nbi.se) owns Silver wrist jewelry.

Dan (jewelry@nbi.se) owns Pearl and Topaz earrings.

Tanya (thaisouvenir@nbi.se) owns Diamond and Amethyst bracelets.
